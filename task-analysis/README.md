# Add/Drop Class Redesign

## The Problem
There is a lot of information that student doesn't really need, and as students, we don't pay much attention to news in different departments. Therefore, we will only leave the necessary information that is directly relevant to the student (such as news from the department that student is part of). It is a very complicated task to get to the stage where you can start picking classes. 
We would like to simplify the process of Add/Drop classes for students by these following steps. 

1. Login
2. Navigating to Acedemics tab
3. Select Add or Drop class
4. Entering Pin & desired semester
5. To Add - Choose either Major, Humanities, Math, Science, or other classes.
6. To Drop - From the week's current schedule, click red "x" to drop classes.

## Login
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/login.JPG "login")
Login page simplified similar to iOS style: 

1. Simple login form with username and password
2. Logo and banner as header design

## Welcome
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/welcome.JPG "welcome")
There will be nav bar with simplified options directly relevant to that student. 

1. Welcome
2. Academics
3. Finances
4. Other Resources

## Academics
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/academics.JPG "academics")
When you click on Academics, there will be further options.

1. Registration Tools
2. Self-Banner Service
3. Other resources

Keeping it simple instead of so many unnecessary task panes that majority of students don't look at. This is more clear and visible for the user. Students usually get lost in the current website. Furthermore, we will change the "excel list" style to more user-friendly modern interface. 

## Entering semester and pin number
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/semester.JPG "select semester")
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/pin.JPG "select pin")

This will be in a "sign in" format to get student's data.
After clicking Add or Drop, we will request the student to enter:

1. Desired semester
2. Pin number

## Add/Drop Page
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/courses.JPG "courses category")
Once you enter, there will be only 2 sections

1. Course search/lookup
2. Student's weekly schedule

## Add
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/itm.JPG "individual courses")
Under course search, there will be 5 options. Instead of looking through the long list of ALL the courses offered in IIT, we will simplify to these 3 categories: Major, Humanities, Math, Science and Other classes.

1. Major classes
2. Humanities classes
3. Mathematics classes
4. Science classes
5. Other classes

Once you find your course and decide to register, it will appear in a schedule section (like in Week at Glance). This will show the exact date and time in the timetable slot, which is very clear for the student. Once you hover onto the class, it will show a bubble (like a message bubble) for further information like location, Professor name and section number.

## Drop
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/add-drop.JPG "week's schedule")
This will show the current schedule of the student in a "week at a glance". In the corner of the course, there will be a red "x" to drop the class. This will keep the design simple and easy to adapt for new students as well. Unlike the current drop class webpage, which shows "excel table style" information and too many steps to drop a class. 

1. It will show current schedule.
2. There will be an red "X" sign next to the current class, to drop it. 

(Our group couldn't provide screenshots of current my.iit webpages of Add/Drop because we need a PIN number to access those pages. It's currently the registration period for Summer & Fall classes. Due to this inconvenience, we will provide those screenshots in the near future.)
